# Nvidia dynamic code optimization
NVIDIA Denver's Dynamic Code Optimization (DCO) dynamically enhances performance and efficiency by profiling executing code to identify hot regions, translating these into optimized micro-operations using advanced compiler techniques. These optimized micro-operations are stored in memory and fetched directly from the L1 cache, bypassing the ARM decoder. This process reduces dependency stalls and increases instruction-level parallelism, significantly boosting throughput. DCO continuously operates in the background, adapting to changing workloads and using speculative execution to prefetch data and instructions, further reducing latency. If speculative execution fails, the system reverts to the hardware decoder. Overall, DCO allows the processor to dynamically optimize code execution, greatly improving performance and energy efficiency.

## Instruction merge
### Experiment setup
We built a program to measure the latencies of certain instructions, specifically on lines 41 - 45. Line 41 uses a sequence of mov instructions in ARM; notably, mov x10, x10 is a redundant instruction. In this context, we aim to determine whether and when these instructions will be merged or dropped during optimization.

 37         );
 38         for(volatile int z = 0; z < 100; z++){}
 39         isb();
 40         init = get_cycles();
 41         MOV(N);
 42         asm volatile(
 43             "adds x1, x1, #1\n"
 44             ::: "x1"
 45         );
 46         end = get_cycles();
 47         isb();
 48         asm volatile(
 49             "str x1, %[val]\n"
 50             :
 51             : [val] "m" (pick)
 52             : "x1"
 53         );
 54         printf("%ld\n", end - init);
 55     }
 56 }

```
### results
We present the result for two `mov` with the `adds`. Most of cases, latency starts to drop at 2000-2500 iterations.

There are also some cases, the latency start to drop earlier, at about 1000 - 1200 iterations.

When we continue to add more redundant mov instructions in the loop, it appears that the optimizer requires more iterations to analyze and optimize the microcode. However, the number of required iterations does not increase step by step; it only shows a general trend of increasing.
### For NOP
When we replace the `mov` with `nop`, similiar behavior still exists.
